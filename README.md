### OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
In this project, the analysis helps Steve expand the dataset to include the entire stock market for 2017 and 2018. Using VBA, the script runs faster which doesn't take a long time to execute.

### SUMMARY
- Refactoring Helps Programming Faster but it's risky when the application is big
- VBA can trap and handle errors but its errors are not well explanatory to direct for corrections
